Simple node module to download the [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/corp/chromium.org/driver/)
version for [Electron](https://electronjs.org).

The major version of this library tracks the major version of the Electron
versions released. So if you are using Electron `2.0.x` you would want to use
an `electron-chromedriver` dependency of `~2.0.0` in your `package.json` file.

This library is used by [spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron).

+BURDEN ESTIMATE STATEMENT
+The estimated average burden associated with this collection of information is 10 minutes per respondent or recordkeeper,
+depending on individual circumstances. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for

+PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY
+ All information on this form, including the individual claim number, is required under 31 USC 3322, 31 CFR 209 and/or
+210. The information is confidential and is needed to prove entitlement to payments. The information will be used to
+process payment data from the Federal agency to the financial institution and/or its agent. Failure to provide the requested
+information may affect the processing of this form and may delay or prevent the receipt of payments through the Direct
+Deposit/Electronic Funds Transfer Program.
+INFORMATION FOUND ON CHECKS
+ Most of the information needed to complete boxes A,
+C, and F in Section 1 is printed on your government
+check:
+Be sure that payee’s name is written exactly as it appears on the check. Be sure current address is shown.
+Claim numbers and suffixes are printed here on checks
+beneath the date for the type of payment shown here.
+Check the Green Book for the location of prefixes and
+suffixes for other types of payments.
+Type of payment is printed to the left of the amount.
+SPECIAL NOTICE TO JOINT ACCOUNT HOLDERS
+ Joint account holders should immediately advise both the Government agency and the financial institution of the death
+of a beneficiary. Funds deposited after the date of death or ineligibility, except for salary payments, are to be returned to
+the Government agency. The Government agency will then make a determination regarding survivor rights, calculate
+survivor benefit payments, if any, and begin payments.
+CANCELLATION
+ The agreement represented by this authorization remains in effect until cancelled by the recipient by notice to the
+Federal agency or by the death or legal incapacity of the recipient. Upon cancellation by the recipient, the recipient should
+notify the receiving financial institution that he/she is doing so.
+ The agreement represented by this authorization may be cancelled by the financial institution by providing the recipient
+a written notice 30 days in advance of the cancellation date. The recipient must immediately advise the Federal agency if
+the authorization is cancelled by the financial institution. The financial institution cannot cancel the authorization by advice
+to the Government agency.
+CHANGING RECEIVING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
+ The payee’s Direct Deposit will continue to be received by the selected financial institution until the Government agency
+is notified by the payee that the payee wishes to change the financial institution receiving the Direct Deposit. To effect this
+change, the payee will complete a new SF 1199A at the newly selected financial institution. It is recommended that the
+payee maintain accounts at both financial institutions until the transition is complete, i.e. after the new financial institution
+receives the payee’s Direct Deposit payment.
+FALSE STATEMENTS OR FRAUDULENT CLAIMS
+ Federal law provides a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than five (5) years or both for
+presenting a false statement or making a fraudulent claim.

+                   For all users of the VM Payment Processing Services, except Network Registered users: These Member Bank Terms become effective only when you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network within any twelve-month period. Importantly, the $1 million threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms is set by each Network, and either Network may change its threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms at any time with no notice to you. Until you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network (or such other processing thresholds as may be established by either Network), these Member Bank Terms are not effective, and you do not have a direct legal agreement with Member Bank with respect to the VM Payment Processing Services. For Network Registered users of the VM Payment Processing Services: These Member Bank Terms become effective when you process your first Transaction on a Network. You understand and agree that Stripe or Member Bank may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to Stripe or Member Bank’s provision of or your use of the VM Payment Processing Services, and you acknowledge that you are directly responsible to Member Bank under the Agreement for any liability to Member Bank caused by your breach of the Agreement. Stripe or Member Bank may also terminate these Member Bank Terms at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use the VM Payment Processing Services. Further, either Network may, at any time for any reason, terminate these Member Bank Terms with respect to Payment Processing Services for its products.

+                   Purpose of these Member Bank Terms When you process more than $1 million within any twelve-month period in Visa or Mastercard Transactions through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, or, if you are Network Registered, when you process your first Visa or Mastercard Transaction through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, applicable Network Rules require you to enter into a direct contractual relationship with the Payment Method Acquirer. These Member Bank Terms constitute your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank, which is a member of the Networks, and a Payment Method Acquirer for Visa and Mastercard Transactions. In accordance with the requirements of the Network Rules, these Member Bank Terms are offered and effective, and your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank is established, as provided in the introductory paragraphs above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   As a Payment Method Acquirer, Member Bank authorizes you to accept payment from your Customers by Visa and Mastercard credit or debit card (“VM Payment Cards”). However, by using the VM Payment Processing Services and accepting VM Payment Cards, you are not establishing a depository or other account with Member Bank. As between Stripe and Member Bank, Stripe is responsible for underwriting and evaluating your eligibility to receive the VM Payment Processing Services, authorizing charges, settling funds to your User Bank Account(s) as provided in Section 4, and providing the VM Payment Processing Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   Stripe, and not Member Bank, will provide customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; however, you may contact Member Bank (using the contact information provided above) in the event you are unable to resolve any matters directly with Stripe. You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   Compliance with Visa and Mastercard Rules When you use the VM Payment Processing Services to accept charges from VM Payment Cards, you must comply with the Network Rules, including the acceptance guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, Disputes, or deposits) set forth therein. Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to Disputes, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of these Member Bank Terms and/or the Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:

+                   The Member Bank Entities assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (b) any misuse of VM Payment Processing Services or Protected Data; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the VM Payment Processing Services; (d) any software bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to, through, or in connection with the VM Payment Processing Services; (e) any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the VM Payment Processing Services or data, or any loss or damage resulting therefrom, regardless of the manner of transmission; or (f) defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   The Member Bank Entities’ cumulative liability to you is limited to direct damages and in all events will not exceed in the aggregate the amount of fees or compensation actually received by Member Bank from Stripe for the Transactions processed for you through the VM Payment Processing Services during the three (3) month period immediately preceding the event that gives rise to the claim for liability. The limitation of liability in the preceding sentence will not apply to claims by you against Member Bank for direct damages for failure to transfer Settlement Funds to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, in which case Member Bank liability for such direct claim by you is limited to the amount of any Settlement Funds that Member Bank failed to transfer to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   Without limiting anything to the contrary above, you agree to provide Member Bank, via a communication with Stripe, with written notice of any alleged breach by Member Bank of these Member Bank Terms, which notice will specifically detail such alleged breach, within sixty (60) days of the date on which you discovered or reasonably should have discovered the alleged breach. Failure to provide notice shall be deemed an acceptance by you and a waiver of any and all rights to dispute such breach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   The foregoing will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction and will apply regardless of the legal theory on which the claim is based, including without limitation contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other basis. The limitations apply even if Stripe or Member Bank have been advised of the possibility of such damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   United States Only Services; No Illegal Activities You may not use the VM Payment Processing Services or services of any kind offered by Member Bank from, or on behalf of persons or entities (a) in a country embargoed by the United States or (b) blocked or denied by the United States government. You further acknowledge and agree that you will not use your Stripe Account and/or the VM Payment Processing Services for illegal Transactions, for example, those prohibited by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5361 et seq., as may be amended from time to time, or those involving any Person listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (available at www.treas.gov/ofac) or the U.S. Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List (available at www.state.gov) or the processing and acceptance of Transactions in certain jurisdictions pursuant to 31 CFR Part 500 et seq. and other laws enforced by OFAC. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the VM Payment Processing Services are solely for use by you in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Member Bank Terms, Member Bank may decline to process any Transaction submitted by you in its sole discretion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   Dispute Resolution All disputes under these Member Bank Terms are subject to the applicable provisions of the Agreement. In particular, the dispute resolution, class action waiver, and arbitration provisions of the Agreement apply to disputes under these Member Bank Terms by, with, or against Member Bank in the same manner they apply to disputes by, with, or against Stripe, except that (a) in the event of arbitration, only a federal court (and not an arbitrator) may determine whether a particular claim is arbitrable, and (b) service to Member Bank must be made to its registered agent or to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
+                   Waiver The failure of Member Bank to assert any of its rights under these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Member Bank of its rights to enforce each and every provision of these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement in accordance with their terms. These Member Bank Terms may be amended by Member Bank or Stripe from time to time in the same manner as the Agreement may be amended by Stripe.

These Member Bank Terms may not be assigned by you without the prior written consent of Member Bank and Stripe. These Member Bank Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, transferees, and assignees. If any provision of these Member Bank Terms are determined to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity of that provision will not affect any of the remaining provisions and these Member Bank Terms will be construed as if such provision is not contained in these Member Bank Terms.

Importantly, the $1 million threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms is set by each Network, and either Network may change its threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms at any time with no notice to you. Until you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network (or such other processing thresholds as may be established by either Network), these Member Bank Terms are not effective, and you do not have a direct legal agreement with Member Bank with respect to the VM Payment Processing Services. For Network Registered users of the VM Payment Processing Services: These Member Bank Terms become effective when you process your first Transaction on a Network. You understand and agree that Stripe or Member Bank may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to Stripe or Member Bank’s provision of or your use of the VM Payment Processing Services, and you acknowledge that you are directly responsible to Member Bank under the Agreement for any liability to Member Bank caused by your breach of the Agreement. Stripe or Member Bank may also terminate these Member Bank Terms at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use the VM Payment Processing Services. Further, either Network may, at any time for any reason, terminate these Member Bank Terms with respect to Payment Processing Services for its products.

If you are a legal entity, including a limited liability company or corporation, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide Member Bank with information on the identity of (1) all beneficial owners of 25% or more of the company; and (2) at least one individual with significant control over the company.

+BURDEN ESTIMATE STATEMENT
+The estimated average burden associated with this collection of information is 10 minutes per respondent or recordkeeper,
+depending on individual circumstances. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for
+reducing this burden should be directed to the Financial Management Service, Facilities Management Division, Property &
+Supply Section, Room B-101, 3700 East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782 or the Office of Management and Budget,

+PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY
+ All information on this form, including the individual claim number, is required under 31 USC 3322, 31 CFR 209 and/or
+210. The information is confidential and is needed to prove entitlement to payments. The information will be used to
+process payment data from the Federal agency to the financial institution and/or its agent. Failure to provide the requested
+information may affect the processing of this form and may delay or prevent the receipt of payments through the Direct
+Deposit/Electronic Funds Transfer Program.
+INFORMATION FOUND ON CHECKS
+ Most of the information needed to complete boxes A,
+C, and F in Section 1 is printed on your government
+check:
+Be sure that payee’s name is written exactly as it appears on the check. Be sure current address is shown.
+Claim numbers and suffixes are printed here on checks
+beneath the date for the type of payment shown here.
+Check the Green Book for the location of prefixes and
+suffixes for other types of payments.
+Type of payment is printed to the left of the amount.
+SPECIAL NOTICE TO JOINT ACCOUNT HOLDERS
+ Joint account holders should immediately advise both the Government agency and the financial institution of the death
+of a beneficiary. Funds deposited after the date of death or ineligibility, except for salary payments, are to be returned to
+the Government agency. The Government agency will then make a determination regarding survivor rights, calculate
+survivor benefit payments, if any, and begin payments.
+CANCELLATION
+ The agreement represented by this authorization remains in effect until cancelled by the recipient by notice to the
+Federal agency or by the death or legal incapacity of the recipient. Upon cancellation by the recipient, the recipient should
+notify the receiving financial institution that he/she is doing so.
+ The agreement represented by this authorization may be cancelled by the financial institution by providing the recipient
+a written notice 30 days in advance of the cancellation date. The recipient must immediately advise the Federal agency if
+the authorization is cancelled by the financial institution. The financial institution cannot cancel the authorization by advice
+to the Government agency.
+CHANGING RECEIVING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
+ The payee’s Direct Deposit will continue to be received by the selected financial institution until the Government agency
+is notified by the payee that the payee wishes to change the financial institution receiving the Direct Deposit. To effect this
+change, the payee will complete a new SF 1199A at the newly selected financial institution. It is recommended that the
+payee maintain accounts at both financial institutions until the transition is complete, i.e. after the new financial institution
+receives the payee’s Direct Deposit payment.
+FALSE STATEMENTS OR FRAUDULENT CLAIMS
+ Federal law provides a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than five (5) years or both for
+presenting a false statement or making a fraudulent claim.
